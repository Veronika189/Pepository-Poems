Literary theory provides a framework for interpreting and analyzing poetry, offering various lenses through which a poem can be understood and critiqued. Below are some of the key theories often applied to the study of poems:

1. Formalism
Formalism focuses on the form and structure of the poem itself, analyzing aspects like meter, rhyme, imagery, and symbolism. This approach looks at the text as an autonomous entity, independent of the author's intent or historical context. Key figures include Roman Jakobson and Cleanth Brooks.

2. Structuralism
Structuralism examines the underlying structures that govern a text, often through the lens of linguistics. It looks at how elements within the poem relate to each other to create meaning. Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic theories heavily influence this approach.

3. Post-Structuralism
Post-Structuralism builds on structuralism but rejects the idea of a fixed meaning. Instead, it posits that meaning is always shifting and dependent on various interpretations. Jacques Derridaâ€™s concept of "deconstruction" is central to this theory, suggesting that texts have multiple, often conflicting meanings.

4. Psychoanalytic Theory
Psychoanalytic theory, based on the work of Sigmund Freud and later Jacques Lacan, analyzes the psychological dimensions of poetry. This includes exploring the unconscious desires and anxieties of the poet, as well as how these are manifested in the text.

5. Marxist Criticism
Marxist criticism views poetry through the lens of class struggle and economic power. It examines how poems reflect, reinforce, or challenge the ideologies of their time. Key figures include Karl Marx and later, Terry Eagleton.

6. Feminist Criticism
Feminist criticism looks at how poetry represents gender roles, power relations, and the experiences of women. It often challenges the traditional canon to include more works by female poets and to critique the portrayal of women in poetry. Key figures include Elaine Showalter and Adrienne Rich.

7. New Historicism
New Historicism examines the historical context in which a poem was written, suggesting that literature and history are interconnected. It looks at the power structures, cultural norms, and social conditions that influenced the creation of the poem. Stephen Greenblatt is a notable proponent of this theory.

8. Postcolonial Criticism
Postcolonial criticism explores themes of colonization, identity, and power in literature. It analyzes how colonial histories and ideologies are reflected and contested in poetry. Edward Said's work on Orientalism is foundational to this approach.

9. Reader-Response Theory
Reader-Response Theory focuses on the reader's experience and interpretation of the poem. It posits that meaning is not inherent in the text but is created through the interaction between the reader and the text. Key figures include Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser.

10. Ecocriticism
Ecocriticism examines the relationship between literature and the environment, exploring how nature is represented in poetry and how literary texts contribute to environmental awareness and activism.

Application Example: William Blake's "The Tyger"
Formalism: Analyzing the poem's regular meter and rhyme scheme, the vivid imagery of the tiger, and the use of rhetorical questions.
Psychoanalytic Theory: Exploring the poem as an expression of the poet's unconscious fears and desires, perhaps viewing the tiger as a symbol of the repressed id.
Marxist Criticism: Considering how the poem reflects industrialization and class conflict, with the tiger representing the powerful and the laboring classes.
Feminist Criticism: Analyzing the gender dynamics within the poem, potentially viewing the tiger as a masculine symbol of power and aggression.
Ecocriticism: Discussing the representation of nature in the poem and its implications for human interaction with the natural world.
By applying these different theoretical lenses, readers can gain a deeper, more nuanced understanding of poetry, uncovering multiple layers of meaning and significance.
